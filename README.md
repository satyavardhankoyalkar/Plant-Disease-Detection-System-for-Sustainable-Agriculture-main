## Overview
The **Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture (P2)** is an innovative project designed to help farmers and agricultural practitioners identify plant diseases early, leading to better management of crops and improved yields. By leveraging machine learning techniques and image processing, this system analyzes images of crops to predict potential diseases and provide actionable recommendations. The system aims to promote sustainable farming practices and reduce the reliance on harmful pesticides.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For training and deploying the machine learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Flask**: For building the web application to interact with users.
- **pandas**: For managing and processing tabular data (CSV files).
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For front-end development of the user interface.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of their crops for disease detection.
- **Disease Prediction**: The system processes the image and predicts possible diseases with a confidence score.
- **Recommendation Engine**: After detecting the disease, the system provides actionable recommendations for disease management.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: A simple, easy-to-navigate dashboard for accessing features.
- **Real-time Results**: Immediate feedback on uploaded images, displaying results and suggestions.
